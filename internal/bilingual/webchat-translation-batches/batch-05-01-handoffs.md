# Webchat Thai Translation Package: batch-05-01-handoffs

Copy this whole Markdown file into an LLM webchat. The model should return
completed Thai `th.md` files for the assigned targets only.

## User Request

Translate or rewrite the assigned English AI vocabulary entries into natural
current Thai. Use the repository rules embedded below. Do not translate
literally. Keep technical English terms when Thai would sound forced.

Return output as separate Markdown blocks, one per target file, using this
format:

````text
FILE: dictionary/<Concept>/th.md
```md
---
term: <Thai or mixed display term>
description: <Thai description under 140 characters>
---

<Thai body>
```
````

Do not edit English source. Do not invent new facts. Preserve links to the
same concepts and link only the first useful occurrence.

## Embedded Translation Calibration

# Translation Calibration

This file is the shared calibration source for Thai work. Every human or AI
agent that writes, edits, or reviews Thai content must read this file before
working.

## Purpose

Thai is source content, not a late-stage README translation. Each Thai entry
should explain the same concept as the English entry, but it may use Thai
sentence structure, examples, and rhythm where that improves clarity.

## Tone

- Clear, direct, and practical.
- Technical, but readable by working developers and AI tool users.
- Plain rather than promotional.
- Not formal government Thai.
- Not slangy or jokey.
- Do not over-explain simple terms just because they are in Thai.

Use short paragraphs. Start each paragraph with a clear sentence. Keep the
existing English register: explain what happens, why it matters, and what to do.

## Hybrid Glossary Policy

Translate when Thai helps the reader understand. Keep English when the English
term is the working term in AI tooling, code, logs, APIs, or product UI. When in
doubt, keep the English technical term and explain it in Thai.

| English term           | Thai rendering         | Policy       | Notes                                    |

Glossary entries can be expanded during translation, but keep this file as the
single source of truth. Do not create competing glossary files.

## Entry Rules

- `term` in Thai frontmatter is the Thai display term.
- `description` must be short, concrete, and under 140 characters.
- Body text should normally be at least 200 words, matching the English content
  standard.
- Usage dialogue should sound like a real working exchange, not a literal
  sentence-by-sentence translation.
- Preserve useful tables, but translate column labels and cell prose when it
  helps readability.
- Link only the first occurrence of another concept in an entry.
- Prefer concept accuracy over literal translation.

## Link Rules

During migration, links should point to concepts rather than language-specific
files whenever the generator supports it. Until then, preserve existing links
and let the infrastructure agent update link handling in one pass.

For Thai prose, link text may be Thai, English, or mixed. Choose the phrase that
reads most naturally while pointing to the same concept.

## Good Thai Example

```md
---
term: บริบท
description: ข้อมูลที่ agent มีอยู่และเกี่ยวข้องกับงานในขณะนั้น
---

บริบทคือข้อมูลที่ [agent](./Agent.md) มีอยู่และเกี่ยวข้องกับงานตรงหน้า ไม่ใช่
ทุกอย่างที่เคยเกิดขึ้นใน session และไม่ใช่แค่จำนวน token ที่ยังเหลือใน
context window

ปัญหามักเกิดเมื่อ agent มีข้อมูลเยอะ แต่ข้อมูลสำคัญไม่ได้อยู่ในจุดที่ model
ใช้ตัดสินใจได้จริง มันอาจเดา API ผิด ใช้ schema เก่า หรือย้อนแย้งกับข้อสรุปที่
คุยกันไปแล้ว วิธีแก้ไม่ใช่ยัดข้อมูลเพิ่มเสมอไป แต่คือเลือกข้อมูลที่เกี่ยวข้อง
และเอาสิ่งรบกวนออก
```

Why it works: it keeps technical terms where useful, explains the failure mode,
and uses natural Thai syntax.

## Bad Thai Example

```md
บริบทคือพลังหลักที่ปลดล็อกคุณค่าทั้งหมดของ agent อย่างมหาศาล เมื่อคุณเข้าใจ
บริบท คุณจะสัมผัสได้ทันทีว่า AI coding กลายเป็นเรื่องง่ายแบบก้าวกระโดด
```

Why it fails: it is promotional, vague, and does not explain mechanism or
action.

## Review Checklist

- The Thai entry explains the same concept as English.
- Thai prose is natural and direct.
- Technical terms follow the glossary policy.
- Description is under 140 characters.
- Usage dialogue sounds realistic.
- Links point to the right concepts.
- Tables are readable in Thai.

## Embedded Thai Translation AI Brief

# Thai Translation AI Brief

Use this brief when assigning GPT-5.5 or another AI agent to translate or
rewrite Thai dictionary entries.

## Authority

`internal/TRANSLATION_CALIBRATION.md` is the source of truth for Thai tone,
hybrid glossary policy, entry rules, link rules, and review criteria. Read it
before writing Thai. If this brief and the calibration file disagree, follow the
calibration file.

Do not create a separate glossary. If a new term policy is needed, propose an
edit to `internal/TRANSLATION_CALIBRATION.md`.

## Translation Goal

Write Thai as source content for working developers and AI tool users. The Thai
entry should explain the same concept as the English entry, but it does not need
to follow English sentence order.

The result should sound like current, ordinary professional Thai:

- clear and direct;
- technical where needed, but not academic;
- practical, with mechanism and consequence made explicit;
- calm, not promotional;
- natural mixed Thai/English for AI tooling terms.

## มาตรฐานภาษาไทย

ให้เขียนเหมือนคนไทยสายเทคนิคอธิบายงานให้เพื่อนร่วมทีมฟัง: ชัด ตรง ใช้คำที่คน
ทำงานกับ AI tooling เห็นจริงในชีวิตประจำวัน และไม่พยายามแปลทุกคำให้เป็นไทยจน
ฝืนธรรมชาติ

หลักที่ต้องรักษา:

- ประโยคแรกของแต่ละย่อหน้าควรบอกแก่นให้ชัดก่อน แล้วค่อยอธิบายเหตุผลหรือผลที่
  ตามมา
- คำอย่าง `agent`, `prompt`, `token`, `tool call`, `sandbox`, `context window`
  ใช้ภาษาอังกฤษได้ตามปกติ ถ้าแปลแล้วทำให้ผู้อ่านต้องเดาความหมายใหม่
- คำอธิบายรอบ ๆ technical term ให้เป็นไทยที่อ่านลื่น ไม่ใช่แปลติดโครงประโยค
  อังกฤษ
- ตัวอย่างและ dialogue ให้ฟังเหมือนบทสนทนาในการทำงานจริง ไม่ใช่ประโยคสาธิตใน
  ตำรา
- น้ำเสียงต้องนิ่งและใช้งานได้จริง: ไม่ขายของ ไม่เล่นคำ ไม่ราชการ ไม่วัยรุ่นจน
  หลุดความน่าเชื่อถือ

รูปแบบที่ควรได้:

```md
บริบทคือข้อมูลที่ agent ใช้ตัดสินใจในงานตรงหน้า ไม่ใช่ทุกอย่างที่เคยเกิดขึ้นใน
session และไม่ใช่แค่จำนวน token ที่เหลือใน context window
```

รูปแบบที่ควรเลี่ยง:

```md
บริบทคือองค์ประกอบอันทรงพลังซึ่งช่วยปลดล็อกศักยภาพสูงสุดของปัญญาประดิษฐ์ในทุก
มิติการทำงาน
```

## What Good Output Feels Like

Thai readers should feel that the entry was written for them, not translated at
them. Keep the concept precise, but use Thai rhythm:

- Put the main point early.
- Prefer short paragraphs.
- Keep concrete AI tooling terms in English when that is how users see them in
  code, logs, API docs, product UI, or repository files.
- Translate surrounding explanation into Thai so the sentence flows naturally.
- Preserve examples, tables, and usage dialogue only when they still help.
- Rewrite dialogue so it sounds like a real working conversation.

## Avoid

- literal word-by-word translation;
- government-formal Thai;
- marketing tone;
- cute or slangy phrasing;
- forced Thai for established technical terms such as `agent`, `prompt`,
  `token`, `tool call`, `sandbox`, or `context window`;
- adding claims that are not supported by the English source;
- hiding uncertainty behind vague phrases.

## Input Contract

Each raw-English batch contains:

- curriculum section and batch metadata;
- exact English source paths;
- exact Thai output target paths;
- full `en.md` content for each assigned concept.

Use only the assigned English entries as concept source unless the batch asks
for more context. Do not edit English files in a translation batch.

## Output Contract

For each assigned concept, write one file:

```text
dictionary/<Concept>/th.md
```

Each `th.md` file must include YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
term: <Thai or mixed display term>
description: <Thai description under 140 characters>
---
```

The body should normally be at least 200 words, excluding frontmatter, unless
the English source is intentionally shorter. Preserve first-link-only behavior:
link another concept only on its first useful occurrence.

## Review Before Handoff

## Raw English

## Clearing

Source: `dictionary/Clearing/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Clearing/th.md`

```md
---
description: Ending the current session and starting a fresh one. The next message begins with an empty session and an empty context window.
---

Ending the current [session](./Session.md) and starting a fresh one. The next message begins with an empty session and an empty [context window](./Context%20window.md). Usually user-driven.

Clearing is the cure for a polluted context. A session accumulates everything: failed attempts, wrong turns, stale [tool results](./Tool%20result.md), abandoned plans. The [model](./Model.md) re-reads all of it on every [turn](./Turn.md), and bad history drags on new work. Deep into a long session the [agent](./Agent.md) gets vaguer and less obedient — instructions you gave clearly get ignored, quality slips, and prodding it to do better doesn't help, because the noise it's wading through is still in its [context](./Context.md). Clearing removes the noise.

Clearing doesn't erase the conversation. Most [harnesses](./Harness.md) keep session history on your computer, so the transcript is still there to read or resume. What's gone is the agent's working state: the model is [stateless](./Stateless.md), so the new session knows nothing the old one knew. If the session holds decisions or progress the next one will need, have the agent write a [handoff artifact](./Handoff%20artifact.md) first, then start the new session by pointing at it.

Compare [compaction](./Compaction.md), which summarises the session into the new context instead of starting empty. Clearing is the blunter tool: nothing carries over, including the junk.

_Usage:_

"It's stuck looping on the failing test."

"Just clear it — start a fresh session with the plan doc and the test file. No point fighting the existing context."
```

## Handoff

Source: `dictionary/Handoff/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Handoff/th.md`

```md
---
description: Transferring agent context from one session to another, with no return path. Carry mechanism varies — artifact, compaction, others.
---

Transferring [agent](./Agent.md) [context](./Context.md) from one [session](./Session.md) to another. The carry mechanism varies — a written [handoff artifact](./Handoff%20artifact.md), an in-memory summary ([compaction](./Compaction.md)), and others. Distinct from [clearing](./Clearing.md) (no transfer at all). Reasons vary: switching roles (planner → implementer), kicking off an [AFK](./AFK.md) run, fanning out to parallel sessions, or freeing up [context window](./Context%20window.md) room.

The receiving session starts with zero context — the [model](./Model.md) is [stateless](./Stateless.md), and nothing from the old session is visible to the new one. Whatever the next session needs has to be carried explicitly; everything else is gone. "No return path" is the constraint that shapes the carry: the new session can't ask the old one what it meant, so the carried material has to stand on its own.

| Mechanism        | Form                                        | Properties                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Handoff artifact | File in the [environment](./Environment.md) | You can read and correct it before anything depends on it; reusable across many sessions |
| Compaction       | Summary in the context window               | Automatic and cheap; harder to inspect; feeds one successor                              |

The visible failure of a bad handoff is relitigation: the new session re-opens decisions the old one had settled, because the carry recorded what was decided but not why. Judge a handoff by what a session with zero context could do with it.

_Usage:_

"Planning session is getting heavy — should I just keep going?"

"Do a handoff. Write the decisions to a doc, clear, start the implementation in a fresh session reading from it."
```

## Primary source

Source: `dictionary/Primary source/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Primary source/th.md`

```md
---
description: The thing itself — code, transcripts, raw data. Complete and authoritative, but expensive to load into context.
---

A source of truth in its original form — the code, the conversation transcript, the raw log, the actual API response. Not an account of the thing; the thing. Counterpart to [secondary source](./Secondary%20source.md).

If you want to know what your codebase does, the code is the primary source. The docs, the architecture diagram, and the README are all descriptions of it — accurate when written, on their own schedule ever since. When an [agent](./Agent.md) confidently asserts something wrong about your project, the question to ask is which source it was working from: an agent that read a doc inherits the doc's staleness; an agent that read the code is reading the current truth.

The cost is what keeps primary sources from being the default. Loading one into the [context window](./Context%20window.md) is expensive — the full file, the full transcript, every [token](./Token.md) billed as [input](./Input%20tokens.md) and competing for [attention budget](./Attention%20budget.md). What you get for the cost is completeness: nothing has been pre-filtered by someone else's judgement about what mattered. A summary written last month can't contain the detail that turned out to matter today; the primary source still does.

Reach for the primary source when precision matters — the exact signature, the actual error, the line that throws. Much of managing [context](./Context.md) is deciding when to pay for the primary source and when a secondary source is good enough.

_Usage:_

"The agent says the retry logic backs off exponentially, but I'm watching it hammer the endpoint."

"It read that out of the design doc. Point it at the actual retry module — work from the primary source when the behaviour matters."
```

## Secondary source

Source: `dictionary/Secondary source/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Secondary source/th.md`

```md
---
description: An account of a primary source, one step removed — summaries, docs, compaction summaries. Cheap to load, lossy by construction.
---

An account of a [primary source](./Primary%20source.md), one step removed — documentation describing code, a summary describing a transcript, a report describing search results. Cheaper to load into the [context window](./Context%20window.md) than the source it describes, and lossy by construction: whoever wrote it decided what mattered, and whatever they dropped is invisible to a reader who only has the summary.

A lot of [context](./Context.md) engineering is the manufacture of secondary sources. [Compaction](./Compaction.md) turns the [session](./Session.md) history into a summary that seeds the next session. A [subagent](./Subagent.md) burns its own context on a noisy search and returns a short report. A [handoff artifact](./Handoff%20artifact.md) condenses a session's decisions into a document the next session reads. [Memory systems](./Memory%20system.md) distil what a session learned into notes. Each makes the same trade: fidelity for headroom.

Secondary sources fail in two ways. They're lossy — the compaction summary that lost the schema decision, the report that didn't mention the edge case. And they drift — the primary source changes and the account doesn't follow, so docs describe last quarter's architecture with this quarter's confidence. When an [agent](./Agent.md) acts on a secondary source that has failed either way, it works confidently from wrong information; the fix is sending it back to the primary source.

Neither failure makes secondary sources a mistake. The context window is finite, and primary sources are expensive; without summaries, reports, and handoff documents, nothing large fits. The skill is knowing which details can survive the loss — and verifying against the primary source when one can't. A well-made secondary source carries a [context pointer](./Context%20pointer.md) back to its original — the summary that names the transcript it came from, the doc that names the file it describes — so when the account isn't enough, the reader can follow the pointer rather than work from the loss.

_Usage:_

"The handoff doc says auth is done, but the new session keeps finding broken token refresh."

"The doc's a secondary source — the last session wrote down what it believed, not what's true. Have the new session run the auth tests and trust the primary source."
```

## Handoff artifact

Source: `dictionary/Handoff artifact/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Handoff artifact/th.md`

```md
---
description: A document used as the carry mechanism for a handoff — written by one session to be read by another.
---

A document used as the carry mechanism for a [handoff](./Handoff.md) — written to the [environment](./Environment.md) by one [session](./Session.md) to be read by another. [Specs](./Spec.md), [tickets](./Ticket.md), and plan docs are all handoff artifacts.

The reason to write one: the [model](./Model.md) is [stateless](./Stateless.md), so nothing in a session survives [clearing](./Clearing.md) it. Decisions, constraints, half-finished plans — all gone with the [context](./Context.md) that held them. The environment persists. Writing the important state into a file moves it somewhere the next session can read it back from.

The artifact is a [secondary source](./Secondary%20source.md) — an account of the session's work, not the work itself. That's what makes it small enough to brief a fresh session, and also why it can mislead one: it records what the writing session believed, and anything it left out or got wrong is invisible to the reader. Where a claim matters, the next session should verify it against the [primary source](./Primary%20source.md) — the code, the tests — rather than inherit it.

A good artifact is written to be read into a session that has zero context. Concrete file paths rather than "the file we discussed". What was decided and why, so the next session doesn't relitigate it. What's done and what's left. It helps to tell the writing session where the artifact is headed: "write a handoff doc for a fresh session that knows nothing about this work".

The alternative carry mechanism is [compaction](./Compaction.md), which summarises in-memory. The artifact has two advantages: it lives on disk where you can read and correct it before anything depends on it, and it can be reused — the same spec can brief five parallel sessions.

_Usage:_

"How do I split this between the planning [agent](./Agent.md) and the implementing one?"

"Have the planner write a handoff artifact — file paths, decisions, constraints. The implementer's session opens with a pointer to the artifact and works from it as its brief."
```

## Spec

Source: `dictionary/Spec/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Spec/th.md`

```md
---
description: A handoff artifact describing a multi-session piece of work — what's being built, not how each session does its share. Made of tickets.
---

A [handoff artifact](./Handoff%20artifact.md) describing a multi-[session](./Session.md) piece of work — what's being built, not how each session does its share. Mutates as work progresses. Made of [tickets](./Ticket.md).

The spec exists because sessions are disposable and big work isn't. Anything that takes more than one [context window](./Context%20window.md) of effort needs a home outside the [context](./Context.md) — somewhere in the agent's [environment](./Environment.md) that survives [clearing](./Clearing.md), whether that's a file in the repo, a GitHub issue, or an issue tracker the agent can reach. The spec is that home: the goal, the constraints, the decisions made so far, and the list of tickets with their status. Any fresh session can read it and know where the work stands without inheriting the previous session's accumulated noise.

Specs come in recognisable styles, mostly inherited from how teams already write things down. A _product requirements document_ (PRD) leans toward the user-facing what and why — features, behaviour, acceptance criteria. A _design doc_ or _RFC_ leans technical — the chosen approach, the alternatives rejected, the trade-offs. At the small end, a plain `plan.md` with a checklist of tickets does the same job for a multi-session feature. The style matters less than the role: for the [agent](./Agent.md), each of these is the same thing — the durable statement of intent it reads at the start of every session.

_Usage:_

"Should this all be one session?"

"No, write it up as a spec — break it into tickets, run each one in its own session. Trying to do the whole thing in a single context will hit the [dumb zone](./Smart%20zone.md) before you're halfway."
```

## Ticket

description: A handoff artifact scoping one session of work. Stands alone or hangs off a spec. Can block or be blocked by sibling tickets.
---

A [handoff artifact](./Handoff%20artifact.md) scoping one [session](./Session.md) of work. Stands alone, or hangs off a [spec](./Spec.md) as one of its children. Tickets can block or be blocked by sibling tickets, so the order of work falls out of their dependency graph rather than a linear plan.

The defining constraint is the size: one session. A ticket should be completable before the session drifts out of the [smart zone](./Smart%20zone.md) — and that constraint is testable. If sessions on your tickets routinely degrade before the work is done, the tickets are too big; split them. If each session spends most of its [context](./Context.md) on setup before doing five minutes of work, they're too small; merge them.

A good ticket is written for a reader with no other context. The goal, the acceptance criteria, and [context pointers](./Context%20pointer.md) to the relevant files and decisions — enough that the session can start working without re-deriving what the last one knew.

The dependency graph is also what unlocks parallelism. Independent tickets — the leaves of the graph — can each run in their own session at the same time. This is an effective way of running multiple agents at once.

_Usage:_

"Where do I start on the migration spec?"

"Look at the ticket graph — the schema change blocks the backfill, the backfill blocks the API switch. Pick a leaf and run a session on it."
```
