# Webchat Thai Translation Package: batch-07-01-patterns-of-work

Copy this whole Markdown file into an LLM webchat. The model should return
completed Thai `th.md` files for the assigned targets only.

## User Request

Translate or rewrite the assigned English AI vocabulary entries into natural
current Thai. Use the repository rules embedded below. Do not translate
literally. Keep technical English terms when Thai would sound forced.

Return output as separate Markdown blocks, one per target file, using this
format:

````text
FILE: dictionary/<Concept>/th.md
```md
---
term: <Thai or mixed display term>
description: <Thai description under 140 characters>
---

<Thai body>
```
````

Do not edit English source. Do not invent new facts. Preserve links to the
same concepts and link only the first useful occurrence.

## Embedded Translation Calibration

# Translation Calibration

This file is the shared calibration source for Thai work. Every human or AI
agent that writes, edits, or reviews Thai content must read this file before
working.

## Purpose

Thai is source content, not a late-stage README translation. Each Thai entry
should explain the same concept as the English entry, but it may use Thai
sentence structure, examples, and rhythm where that improves clarity.

## Tone

- Clear, direct, and practical.
- Technical, but readable by working developers and AI tool users.
- Plain rather than promotional.
- Not formal government Thai.
- Not slangy or jokey.
- Do not over-explain simple terms just because they are in Thai.

Use short paragraphs. Start each paragraph with a clear sentence. Keep the
existing English register: explain what happens, why it matters, and what to do.

## Hybrid Glossary Policy

Translate when Thai helps the reader understand. Keep English when the English
term is the working term in AI tooling, code, logs, APIs, or product UI. When in
doubt, keep the English technical term and explain it in Thai.

| English term           | Thai rendering         | Policy       | Notes                                    |

| AI                     | AI                     | Keep English | Use as the normal term.                  |
| agent                  | agent                  | Keep English | Avoid forced translations like ตัวแทน.   |
| model                  | model                  | Keep English | Use โมเดล only if prose needs Thai flow. |
| prompt                 | prompt                 | Keep English | Common tool term.                        |

Glossary entries can be expanded during translation, but keep this file as the
single source of truth. Do not create competing glossary files.

## Entry Rules

- `term` in Thai frontmatter is the Thai display term.
- `description` must be short, concrete, and under 140 characters.
- Body text should normally be at least 200 words, matching the English content
  standard.
- Usage dialogue should sound like a real working exchange, not a literal
  sentence-by-sentence translation.
- Preserve useful tables, but translate column labels and cell prose when it
  helps readability.
- Link only the first occurrence of another concept in an entry.
- Prefer concept accuracy over literal translation.

## Link Rules

During migration, links should point to concepts rather than language-specific
files whenever the generator supports it. Until then, preserve existing links
and let the infrastructure agent update link handling in one pass.

For Thai prose, link text may be Thai, English, or mixed. Choose the phrase that
reads most naturally while pointing to the same concept.

## Good Thai Example

```md
---
term: บริบท
description: ข้อมูลที่ agent มีอยู่และเกี่ยวข้องกับงานในขณะนั้น
---

บริบทคือข้อมูลที่ [agent](./Agent.md) มีอยู่และเกี่ยวข้องกับงานตรงหน้า ไม่ใช่
ทุกอย่างที่เคยเกิดขึ้นใน session และไม่ใช่แค่จำนวน token ที่ยังเหลือใน
context window

ปัญหามักเกิดเมื่อ agent มีข้อมูลเยอะ แต่ข้อมูลสำคัญไม่ได้อยู่ในจุดที่ model
ใช้ตัดสินใจได้จริง มันอาจเดา API ผิด ใช้ schema เก่า หรือย้อนแย้งกับข้อสรุปที่
คุยกันไปแล้ว วิธีแก้ไม่ใช่ยัดข้อมูลเพิ่มเสมอไป แต่คือเลือกข้อมูลที่เกี่ยวข้อง
และเอาสิ่งรบกวนออก
```

Why it works: it keeps technical terms where useful, explains the failure mode,
and uses natural Thai syntax.

## Bad Thai Example

```md
บริบทคือพลังหลักที่ปลดล็อกคุณค่าทั้งหมดของ agent อย่างมหาศาล เมื่อคุณเข้าใจ
บริบท คุณจะสัมผัสได้ทันทีว่า AI coding กลายเป็นเรื่องง่ายแบบก้าวกระโดด
```

Why it fails: it is promotional, vague, and does not explain mechanism or
action.

## Review Checklist

- The Thai entry explains the same concept as English.
- Thai prose is natural and direct.
- Technical terms follow the glossary policy.
- Description is under 140 characters.
- Usage dialogue sounds realistic.
- Links point to the right concepts.
- Tables are readable in Thai.

## Embedded Thai Translation AI Brief

# Thai Translation AI Brief

Use this brief when assigning GPT-5.5 or another AI agent to translate or
rewrite Thai dictionary entries.

## Authority

`internal/TRANSLATION_CALIBRATION.md` is the source of truth for Thai tone,
hybrid glossary policy, entry rules, link rules, and review criteria. Read it
before writing Thai. If this brief and the calibration file disagree, follow the
calibration file.

Do not create a separate glossary. If a new term policy is needed, propose an
edit to `internal/TRANSLATION_CALIBRATION.md`.

## Translation Goal

Write Thai as source content for working developers and AI tool users. The Thai
entry should explain the same concept as the English entry, but it does not need
to follow English sentence order.

The result should sound like current, ordinary professional Thai:

- clear and direct;
- technical where needed, but not academic;
- practical, with mechanism and consequence made explicit;
- calm, not promotional;
- natural mixed Thai/English for AI tooling terms.

## มาตรฐานภาษาไทย

ให้เขียนเหมือนคนไทยสายเทคนิคอธิบายงานให้เพื่อนร่วมทีมฟัง: ชัด ตรง ใช้คำที่คน
ทำงานกับ AI tooling เห็นจริงในชีวิตประจำวัน และไม่พยายามแปลทุกคำให้เป็นไทยจน
ฝืนธรรมชาติ

หลักที่ต้องรักษา:

- ประโยคแรกของแต่ละย่อหน้าควรบอกแก่นให้ชัดก่อน แล้วค่อยอธิบายเหตุผลหรือผลที่
  ตามมา
- คำอย่าง `agent`, `prompt`, `token`, `tool call`, `sandbox`, `context window`
  ใช้ภาษาอังกฤษได้ตามปกติ ถ้าแปลแล้วทำให้ผู้อ่านต้องเดาความหมายใหม่
- คำอธิบายรอบ ๆ technical term ให้เป็นไทยที่อ่านลื่น ไม่ใช่แปลติดโครงประโยค
  อังกฤษ
- ตัวอย่างและ dialogue ให้ฟังเหมือนบทสนทนาในการทำงานจริง ไม่ใช่ประโยคสาธิตใน
  ตำรา
- น้ำเสียงต้องนิ่งและใช้งานได้จริง: ไม่ขายของ ไม่เล่นคำ ไม่ราชการ ไม่วัยรุ่นจน
  หลุดความน่าเชื่อถือ

รูปแบบที่ควรได้:

```md
บริบทคือข้อมูลที่ agent ใช้ตัดสินใจในงานตรงหน้า ไม่ใช่ทุกอย่างที่เคยเกิดขึ้นใน
session และไม่ใช่แค่จำนวน token ที่เหลือใน context window
```

รูปแบบที่ควรเลี่ยง:

```md
บริบทคือองค์ประกอบอันทรงพลังซึ่งช่วยปลดล็อกศักยภาพสูงสุดของปัญญาประดิษฐ์ในทุก
มิติการทำงาน
```

## What Good Output Feels Like

Thai readers should feel that the entry was written for them, not translated at
them. Keep the concept precise, but use Thai rhythm:

- Put the main point early.
- Prefer short paragraphs.
- Keep concrete AI tooling terms in English when that is how users see them in
  code, logs, API docs, product UI, or repository files.
- Translate surrounding explanation into Thai so the sentence flows naturally.
- Preserve examples, tables, and usage dialogue only when they still help.
- Rewrite dialogue so it sounds like a real working conversation.

## Avoid

- literal word-by-word translation;
- government-formal Thai;
- marketing tone;
- cute or slangy phrasing;
- forced Thai for established technical terms such as `agent`, `prompt`,
  `token`, `tool call`, `sandbox`, or `context window`;
- adding claims that are not supported by the English source;
- hiding uncertainty behind vague phrases.

## Input Contract

Each raw-English batch contains:

- curriculum section and batch metadata;
- exact English source paths;
- exact Thai output target paths;
- full `en.md` content for each assigned concept.

Use only the assigned English entries as concept source unless the batch asks
for more context. Do not edit English files in a translation batch.

## Output Contract

For each assigned concept, write one file:

```text
dictionary/<Concept>/th.md
```

Each `th.md` file must include YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
term: <Thai or mixed display term>
description: <Thai description under 140 characters>
---
```

The body should normally be at least 200 words, excluding frontmatter, unless
the English source is intentionally shorter. Preserve first-link-only behavior:
link another concept only on its first useful occurrence.

## Review Before Handoff

Check every file against this list:

- Same concept meaning as English.
- Natural Thai for current Thai technical readers.
- Hybrid glossary follows `internal/TRANSLATION_CALIBRATION.md`.
- `description` is concrete and under 140 characters.
- Links point to the right concepts.
- Tables and dialogue read naturally.
- No unrelated English edits.

## Raw English

## Human-in-the-loop

Source: `dictionary/Human-in-the-loop/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Human-in-the-loop/th.md`

```md
---
description: A working pattern where one or more humans pair with the agent during a session — reviewing, redirecting, or collaborating in real time.
aliases:
  - HITL
  - Human-in-the-loop (HITL)
---

A working pattern where one or more humans pair with the [agent](./Agent.md) during a [session](./Session.md) — reviewing, redirecting, or collaborating in real time. The human is present and engaged, not just gating individual actions.

The contrast is with [AFK](./AFK.md) work, where the agent runs unattended and you judge the result afterwards. Human-in-the-loop means catching problems while they're still cheap: you see the agent reach for the wrong file, misread the requirement, or start down a dead end, and you redirect it in one sentence — rather than discovering twenty minutes of confident work built on that mistake. Agents don't reliably know when they're off track; left alone, they tend to push forward rather than stop and ask.

Which pattern fits depends on the work. Well-specified, low-risk, easy-to-verify tasks suit AFK. Tasks that are ambiguous, irreversible, or where you'd struggle to review the finished result — a schema migration, a tricky design decision, anything touching production — suit staying in the loop. The judgement call is essentially: how expensive is a wrong turn, and how late would you catch it?

Some work is in-the-loop by nature, because your reactions are the input. [Grilling](./Grilling.md) only works with you there to answer the questions; [prototyping](./Prototyping.md) only works with you there to react to the artifact.

Staying in the loop costs your attention, which is the scarce resource. Part of getting better with agents is moving more work safely out of the loop — with plans, [automated checks](./Automated%20check.md), and [human review](./Human%20review.md) at the end instead of supervision throughout.

_Usage:_

"Run this AFK overnight?"

"No, schema migration — keep it human-in-the-loop. I want to see each step and steer if it picks the wrong column to backfill from."
```

## AFK

Source: `dictionary/AFK/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/AFK/th.md`

```md
---
description: A working pattern where the user kicks off a session and leaves the agent to run unattended (away from keyboard).
aliases:
  - away from keyboard
  - AFK (away from keyboard)
---

Away from keyboard. A working pattern where the user kicks off a [session](./Session.md) and leaves the [agent](./Agent.md) to run unattended. The throughput multiplier of [AI](./AI.md) coding — many AFK sessions can run in parallel while you sleep, eat, or work on something else. Usually requires a permissive [permission mode](./Permission%20mode.md) plus [sandboxing](./Sandbox.md) to be safe.

When you're not there, the agent handles ambiguity differently. While you're watching, an ambiguous decision surfaces as a question and you answer it; once you've walked away, the agent picks a default and keeps going, and every later decision builds on that guess. The characteristic failure is coming back to hours of finished, confident work built on a wrong call made in the first ten minutes. The work isn't sloppy — it's coherent, just coherent about the wrong thing.

Since you can't give input during the run, give it before and after instead. Before: resolve the ambiguity up front — a [grilling](./Grilling.md) session, a written [spec](./Spec.md) — so there are fewer gaps for the agent to fill alone. During: [automated checks](./Automated%20check.md) and [automated review](./Automated%20review.md) stand in for the attention you're not giving, failing fast on what can be caught mechanically. After: the run ends in something reviewable — a PR, not changes already merged. AFK doesn't remove [human review](./Human%20review.md); it defers all of it to the end, which is why what arrives at the end has to be worth reviewing. This is also why [AX](./AX.md) matters most in AFK runs — with no one watching, the environment is the only support the agent gets.

_Avoid:_ "background agent" — centers the machine ("running in the background") rather than the human pattern ("user has walked away"). AFK names the fact that matters: the user isn't watching.

_Usage:_

"I'm running this AFK — three sandboxed agents on the refactor, reviewing the PRs in the morning."

"[Bypass permissions](./Agent%20mode.md)?"

"Yeah, read-only [filesystem](./Filesystem.md), no network."
```

## Automated check

Source: `dictionary/Automated check/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Automated check/th.md`

```md
---
description: A deterministic verification that runs in the environment — tests, type checks, lints, build, pre-commit hooks. Pass/fail, no judgement.
---

A deterministic verification that runs in the [environment](./Environment.md) — tests, type checks, lints, build, pre-commit hooks. Pass/fail, no judgement. The signal an [agent](./Agent.md) can self-correct from without involving anyone else. A flaky test is a broken check, not a non-check; automated checks are deterministic _by design_.

Self-correction works as a loop. The agent makes a change, runs the check as a [tool call](./Tool%20call.md), and the failure output lands in its [context window](./Context%20window.md) — a type error with a file and line, a failing assertion with expected and actual values. That's enough for the agent to fix the problem and run the check again, around and around until it passes, with no human in the loop. Determinism is what makes the loop trustworthy: the same code always produces the same verdict, so a pass means something. A flaky check poisons this — the agent "fixes" code that was fine, or retries past a real failure.

This is why good checks are a large part of a codebase's [AX](./AX.md). An agent in a repo with strict types, a fast test suite, and a linter catches most of its own mistakes before you see them; an agent in a repo with none of those ships whatever it produces. The difference matters most in [AFK](./AFK.md) runs, where checks are the only verification happening during the run. But a check only catches what it asserts — green checks mean the asserted properties hold, not that the code is right. The judgement-shaped gaps are what [automated review](./Automated%20review.md) and [human review](./Human%20review.md) are for.

_Avoid:_ "feedback loop" / "backpressure" — both lump checks together with review. _Avoid:_ "test" — tests are automated checks, but not all automated checks are tests.

_Usage:_

"The agent keeps shipping broken code in the AFK runs."

"What automated checks are wired into the [sandbox](./Sandbox.md)?"

"Just the unit tests."

"Add typecheck and lint — it'll self-correct from those before the PR ever lands."
```

## Automated review

Source: `dictionary/Automated review/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Automated review/th.md`

```md
---
description: "An agent reviewing another agent's work, often with a different model or system prompt. Non-deterministic: it forms a judgement."
---

An [agent](./Agent.md) reviewing another agent's work, often with a different [model](./Model.md) or [system prompt](./System%20prompt.md). Non-deterministic: it forms a judgement. Runs anywhere — pre-merge on a PR, post-hoc on commit history, mid-session as a [subagent](./Subagent.md). An LLM-as-judge in CI is automated review, not an [automated check](./Automated%20check.md); what the assertion _does_ decides the category, not where it runs.

The separation from the working agent is what makes it work. Asking the agent that wrote the code to review its own work gets you very little — the [session](./Session.md) that produced the bug also contains the reasoning that produced it, and the agent reads its own conclusions back as confirmation. A reviewer with a fresh [context window](./Context%20window.md) has none of that attachment: it sees the diff the way a stranger would, which is what review depends on. A different model or a review-specific system prompt sharpens this further — different blind spots, and a system prompt scoped to what you actually care about (security, API contracts, performance) rather than a vague "look for problems".

It slots between the other review layers. Automated checks are deterministic and catch what can be asserted mechanically; [human review](./Human%20review.md) is expensive and scales worst. Automated review sits in the middle: it catches judgement-shaped problems — a misleading function name, a missed edge case — at machine cost. Because it's non-deterministic, it can miss things and flag non-issues; treat it as a filter that raises the floor before a human looks, not a gate that replaces one.

_Avoid:_ "AI review" / "agent review" — too vague to distinguish from the working agent itself.

_Usage:_

"We're getting too many bad PRs from the [AFK](./AFK.md) runs."

"Add an automated review step before merge — different model, separate system prompt, scoped to security and contract changes."
```

## Human review

Source: `dictionary/Human review/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Human review/th.md`

```md
---
description: The user reading the code the agent produced and forming a judgement on it. Reading the diff counts; reading the summary doesn't.
---

The user reading the code the [agent](./Agent.md) produced and forming a judgement on it. Reading the diff or the changed files counts; reading the agent's _description_ of what it did does not — narration is not the artifact. The description is a [secondary source](./Secondary%20source.md), written by the party being reviewed; the diff is the [primary source](./Primary%20source.md), and review means reading it.

Agents raise the volume of code produced, so review becomes the bottleneck. One useful idea is layering different review strategies. [Automated checks](./Automated%20check.md) catch the mechanical failures, [automated review](./Automated%20review.md) catches the describable ones, and human review is reserved for what only you can judge — whether the change is the right change, whether the approach fits the codebase, whether this should exist at all.

Review is also cheaper earlier. Reading a plan before work starts, or a small diff mid-flight, takes minutes; excavating a finished branch after an [AFK](./AFK.md) run takes longer. Where you place the review checkpoint is a [human-in-the-loop](./Human-in-the-loop.md) decision, not an afterthought.

_Avoid:_ "code review" alone — ambiguous between human and automated.

_Usage:_

"I human-reviewed the AFK output."

"You read the diff or just the summary?"

"Diff. The summary said it deleted dead code — turned out the function was called from a generated file."
```

## Vibe coding

Source: `dictionary/Vibe coding/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Vibe coding/th.md`

```md
---
description: A working pattern where the user accepts the agent's code without human review. The diff is treated as opaque.
---

A working pattern where the user accepts the [agent](./Agent.md)'s code without [human review](./Human%20review.md). The diff is treated as opaque — what matters is whether the program behaves, not what's inside. [Automated review](./Automated%20review.md) and [automated checks](./Automated%20check.md) may still run; vibe coding is silent on both.

The term comes from Andrej Karpathy, who [coined it in early 2025](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383): you "fully give in to the vibes" and "forget that the code even exists" — describe what you want, accept what comes back, and judge it by running it.

Vibe coding trades inspection for speed. Reading diffs is usually the slowest step in agent-driven work, so dropping it removes the main bottleneck. For code whose failures are cheap — [prototypes](./Prototyping.md), one-off scripts, internal tools — that's a reasonable trade. The risk scales with the code's lifespan and stakes.

The cost arrives later. Vibe-coded changes accumulate into a codebase nobody has read, and behaviour was the only thing checked — so anything behaviour doesn't surface, like a secret written to logs, a missing edge case, or quietly wrong data handling, ships unseen. The first time someone debugs the system is the first time anyone reads the code. With human review gone, whatever automated verification still runs — tests, types, automated review — is the only gate the code passes through.

_Avoid:_ "vibe coding" as a synonym for "low-quality AI coding" — the term names the review stance, not the resulting code.

_Usage:_

"Did you read what it changed in the auth flow?"

"Vibe coded it — login still works, that's all I checked."

"Read the diff before you push, vibing on auth is how secrets leak into logs."
```

## Design concept

Source: `dictionary/Design concept/en.md`

Target: `dictionary/Design concept/th.md`

```md

description: The shared understanding of what's being built, held in common between user and agent but separate from any asset.
---

The shared understanding of what's being built, held in common between user and [agent](./Agent.md) but separate from any asset. Brooks' term (_The Design of Design_): the conversation, [handoff artifacts](./Handoff%20artifact.md), and the code are all assets that try to capture or reach the design concept, but none of them _are_ it. Quality of the design concept is felt through the quality of the conversation that built it.

The term names the gap behind a familiar frustration: the agent writes exactly what you asked for and it's still wrong. The usual cause is that you hadn't fully figured out what you wanted. The design concept wasn't finished in your own head — your prompt captured the parts you'd worked out, and was silent on the parts you hadn't. The agent filled those silences with its own assumptions, because there was nothing to align with. Nothing malfunctioned. There was no shared design concept, because there wasn't yet a whole one to share.

You can tell a design concept is shared the same way you can with a colleague: the other party starts answering questions you haven't asked yet the way you would. Until then, the work is conversation — [grilling](./Grilling.md) is the deliberate version — and writing a [spec](./Spec.md) too early just captures the misalignment in a more durable asset. The design concept also moves as you learn; assets lag it, which is why a spec faithful to last week's understanding can still mislead this week's session.

_Usage:_

"It's writing exactly what I asked for and it's still wrong."

"You don't share a design concept yet — it's filling gaps with assumptions. Keep talking until cancellation, refunds, and partial fulfilment all line up between you before you let it write a spec."
```
